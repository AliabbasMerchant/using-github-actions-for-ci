Welcome! I found a bug. Help me set up CI so we can do some automated testing.

1. Go to the [Actions tab]({{ actionsUrl }}).
1. Choose the template Node.js workflow
1. Commit the workflow to a new branch.
1. Create a pull request titled "CI for Node"

I'll respond in the new pull request when I detect it has been created.
