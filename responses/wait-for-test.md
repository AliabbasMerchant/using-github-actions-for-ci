Great! We've now got two nicely separated `build` and `test` jobs. 

Let's wait for the Actions workflow to run. I'll respond when it does.

When a GitHub Actions workflow is running, you should see some checks in progress, like the screenshot below. 

![checks in progress in a merge box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/66080348-ecc5f580-e533-11e9-909e-c213b08790eb.png)

If the checks don't appear or if the checks are stuck in progress, there's a few things you can do to try and trigger them:

- Refresh the page, it's possible the workflow ran and the page just hasn't been updated with that change
- Try making a commit on this branch. Our workflow is triggered with a `push` event, and committing to this branch will result in a new `push`
- Edit the workflow file on GitHub and ensure there are no red lines indicating a syntax problem
