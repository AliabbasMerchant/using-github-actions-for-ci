We have a custom workflow! Can GitHub Actions support this workflow?

We need:
- [ ] branch protections
- [ ] required review approvals
- [ ] easy way to see when enough approvals has been achieved
- [ ] matrix build
- [ ] save build artifacts
- [ ] dedicated test job

We'll tackle some of the changes to the existing workflow file first. 

Please:
1. Edit your [existing workflow]({{ workflowUrl }}) file in a new branch
1. In that file, target versions `8.x` and `10.x` of Node, only.
1. Open a new pull request titled **Improve CI** for your change.

I'll respond when you open the pull request.
