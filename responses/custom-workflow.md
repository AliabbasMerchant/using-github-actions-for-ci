We have a custom workflow! Can GitHub Actions support this workflow?

We need:
- [ ] branch protections
- [ ] required review approvals
- [ ] easy way to see when enough approvals has been achieved
- [ ] matrix build
- [ ] save build artifacts
- [ ] dedicated test job

We'll tackle some of the changes to the existing workflow file first. Please open a PR to target different Node versions.
