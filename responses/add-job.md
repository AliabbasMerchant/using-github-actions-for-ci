Great work! It's time to practice jobs. Let's create a new job called `labelWhenApproved`. In this job, we'll use an action that adds a label to any pull requests that have a preset number of approvals. These labels could be used as a visual indicator to your team that something is ready to merge, or even as a way to use other actions or tools to automatically merge pull requests when they receive the required number of approvals.
