Awesome! Let's use branch protections in combination with this change so that everything goes smoothly. Up until now, I've handled branch protections for you, but I've removed them so that you can learn how to set them. 

Take a look at the merge box, you'll notice you can merge this even though the review process hasn't been met. Still see the protection? Refresh this page. 

Please add [branch protections in Settings]({{ settingsUrl }}), and then approve this PR. I'll respond when you approve.
