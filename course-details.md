GitHub Actions makes it easier than ever to incorporate continuous integration (CI) into your repositories. 
â€‹
This course will get you from zero-to-CI by setting up two workflow files to automate the way you work.


## What you'll learn

We'll answer common questions like:

- What is Continuous Integration?
- How do GitHub Actions and workflows enable CI?
- What are build artifacts and how are they used?
- How can a unit testing framework be implemented with GitHub Actions?

And when you're done you'll be able to:
- Describe the importance of GitHub Actions in Continuous Integration
- Use and customize a templated workflow
- Create CI workflows that match a team's needs and behaviors
- Use a repository's source code and build artifacts across jobs in a workflow
- Implement a unit testing framework using GitHub Actions
- Create a workflow that runs tests and produces test reports
- Set up a matrix build to create build artifacts for multiple target platforms
- Save and access a repository's build artifacts
- Choose virtual environments for an application's CI needs

## What you'll build
In this course, we'll be walking through CI using GitHub Actions, and creating a Tic Tac Toe game!
